# References Folder

This is for third party reference stuff

A rough (very rough!) analogy is using npm or nuget packages  
i.e If the code was written by somebody else and you aren't going to edit it, then it should live here.

Currently it has:

- the constants contained in the [48 ZX Spectrum rom and memeory](https://worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/zxmanchap24.html) 
  - i.e. screen and attribute addresses but later I will add more like the print routine, blah blah
- The `unit_tests.inc` needed to run ... er... unit tests in DeZog from [The Maziac z80 sample program](https://github.com/maziac/z80-sample-program/blob/main/unit_tests.inc)
- I'll probably bring the goodies from [BreakIntoProgram's lib-spectrum routines](https://github.com/breakintoprogram/lib-spectrum)
