# Explore.ZxSpectrum.Template

Let's setup a 48K ZX Spectrum dev environment in GitHub Codespaces - with DeZog ðŸ§®

## Why bother?

Let's make this

- Easy to win

## Open the Dev Environment in GitHub Codespaces - right now

TL:DR

1. Make a repo based on this repo template
2. Open the codespace
3. [Setup the SjASMPlus to compile](#setup-sjasmplus-to-run-in-the-workspace)
4. `Ctrl-Shift-D` to debug
   - The ZSim emulator should open and show a little green square
6. `Ctrl-Shift-B` to build
7. Run the unit tests
   - There should be the 2 unit tests for the square showing

### Setup SjASMPlus to run in the workspace

Currently the codespace (i.e. linux docker) setup of the SjASMPlus compiler is a manual task.  
If you pull this repo to a Windows desktop, it should just run because the Windows exe is already in the tools folder.

1. Open the bash terminal and run these step by step:
  ```bash
  unzip tools/sjasmplus.1.18.3.zip -d tools

  cd tools/sjasmplus-1.18.3
  make clean
  make
  sudo make install
  ```
2. Delete the `tools/sjasmplus-1.18.3` afterwards

### Run

- Build with `Ctrl-Shipt-B`
- Debug with `Ctrl-Shift-D` or `F5`
- Currently you need to build and _then_ run the unit tests

## TODO: 

Stuff I need to do to make this repo 'Just-Work(tm)'

1. Document the 'open this in GitHub Codespaces' better - inc screenshots
2. Make a 'SjASMPlus Setup' task
3. Find out why 'Run unit tests' doesnt automatically build
